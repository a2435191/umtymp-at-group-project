## Links to previous topics
* Will already knew a good bit about permutations and cycle notation
* (Unused) The determinant of a matrix can be represented by permutations
* Previously covered groups like $D_4$ being permutation groups

## New ideas
* Array notation vs cycle notation
* Spatial geometry (e.g. $D_4$, Rubik's cube group) being represented by permutations and permutation groups

## Surprising results
* Cayley's theorem is surprisingâ€” that *all* groups have an isomorphism to a permutation group is unexpected

## Further questions
* We spent a lot of time reasoning about array notation (functions vs. rearrangements). How does our textbook author reason about this?
* Have theorems in seemingly unrelated parts of mathematics, or at least other parts of group theory, been proven by using Cayley's Theorem to transform a problem into one of permutations?
